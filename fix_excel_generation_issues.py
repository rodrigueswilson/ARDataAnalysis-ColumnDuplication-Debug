Comprehensive Fix for Excel Generation Issues

This script implements the fix to include all valid dates from 2021-09-13
in the zero-fill logic, which should resolve:
1. Left-aligned numbers in Excel sheets
2. The 359/358/1 discrepancy in file counts
3. Period start date ambiguity (2021-09-13 vs 2021-09-20)
4. Inconsistent handling between Daily/Weekly ACF/PACF sheets

The fix modifies the _fill_missing_collection_days method to ensure
all collection days from the official start date are included.
