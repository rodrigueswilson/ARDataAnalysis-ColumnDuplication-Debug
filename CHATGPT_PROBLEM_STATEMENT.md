# ChatGPT Code Review Request: 4x Column Duplication Bug

## üéØ Specific Problem

**ISSUE**: ACF/PACF sheets in Excel reports have 4x column duplication (50 columns instead of ~15)

**STATUS**: Pipeline caching fixes implemented but duplication persists

## üîç What We Need Help With

1. **Identify the root cause** of column accumulation in ACF/PACF analysis
2. **Find hidden DataFrame mutations** or reference issues
3. **Locate orchestration logic** that might be accumulating columns

## üìã Key Evidence

### ‚úÖ What's Working
- Pipeline caching is functional (cache hit/miss messages confirm this)
- Individual ACF/PACF functions work correctly in isolation
- No duplicate pipeline executions detected

### ‚ùå What's Still Broken
- ACF/PACF sheets have 50 columns (4x the expected ~12-15)
- Column pattern suggests 4x multiplication of ACF/PACF columns
- Issue occurs only in full workflow, not isolated tests

## üéØ Focus Areas for Analysis

### Primary Suspects
1. **`ar_utils.py`** - ACF/PACF analysis functions
   - `add_acf_pacf_analysis()` - Adds ACF/PACF columns
   - `reorder_with_acf_pacf()` - Column reordering
   
2. **`sheet_creators/pipeline.py`** - Sheet creation logic
   - `_create_pipeline_sheet()` - Individual sheet creation
   - ACF/PACF integration logic
   
3. **`report_generator/core.py`** - Orchestration
   - `generate_report()` - Main workflow
   - Sheet coordination logic

### Specific Questions
- Are DataFrames being shared/mutated across sheets?
- Is ACF/PACF analysis being called multiple times on the same DataFrame?
- Is there hidden orchestration logic accumulating columns?

## üîß Recent Changes (For Context)
- Added `_run_aggregation_cached()` to `dashboard.py` and `base.py`
- Implemented pipeline caching to prevent duplicate executions
- Added fresh data fetching per sheet

## üìä Expected vs Actual
```
Expected ACF/PACF Sheet:
- Base columns: ~7-8 (Date, Total_Files, etc.)
- ACF columns: ~5 (ACF_Lag_1, ACF_Lag_2, etc.)
- PACF columns: ~5 (PACF_Lag_1, PACF_Lag_2, etc.)
- Total: ~15-18 columns

Actual ACF/PACF Sheet:
- Total: ~50 columns (4x duplication)
- Suggests ACF/PACF columns are being added 4 times
```

## üöÄ How to Help

1. **Review the key files** mentioned above
2. **Look for DataFrame mutation patterns** or shared references
3. **Identify any loops or orchestration logic** that might accumulate columns
4. **Suggest specific debugging approaches** to isolate the issue
